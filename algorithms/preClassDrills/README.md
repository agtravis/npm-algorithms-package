# Pre-Class Drills

These are the algorithms that were presented to be solved before each class.

```js
const { algorithms } = require(`npm-algorithms-package`);
```

First, destructure the Pre Class Drills:

```js
const { preClassDrills } = algorithms;
```

Then you can run the following functions:

```js
preClassDrills.greatestOfTwo.greatestOfTwo(1, 2); // === 2
preClassDrills.greatestOfTwo.greatestOfTwoReturnTernary(4, -6); // === 4
preClassDrills.greatestOfTwo.greatestOfTwoReturnMax(3.4, 2); // === 3.4
```
